The project aims to design and build a scaled prototype of a motor imagery controlled all-terrain mobility platform. It uses machine learning to process and decode the EEG signals that are sourced from a pre-recorded EEG dataset. The hardware includes a transport mechanism with motor-driven leg assemblies and the necessary electronic components such as motor driver, planetary gearbox, voltage regulator, and the Arduino microcontroller. The software runs on a Raspberry Pi, processes EEG data, classifies the motor imagery, and translates it into the movement commands for the mobility platform. The project sets specific design criteria and constraints and outlines a comprehensive testing plan to ensure that the platform meets the defined criteria and constraints.
